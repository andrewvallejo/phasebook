# Phasebook

An application that allows you to search for other robots from your school. You will be able to find their email, skills, and test scores. You can label tags onto any robot in order to help you catagorize them. You can also filter by tags, or by their names.

## Chunkers Frontend Tech Challenge

> "The goal of this assessment is to replicate the frontend applicationgit c below as close as possible."

The project is broken into five parts, each with a feature and a wireframe that I meant to replicate from the instructions provided. I have chosen to use React as my framework as well as utilizing other technologies such as Redux and Tailwind CSS.
